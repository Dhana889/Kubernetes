The ideal Kubernetes cluster set-up for applications servers depends on various factors, including the nature of the applications, their resource requirements, the expected traffic patterns, and the need for high availability and fault tolerance. Here is a general guideline to help you design a suitable Kubernetes cluster:

1. Cluster Size and Node Configuration:
* Master Nodes:

  * Number of Masters: At least 3 master nodes to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
  * Instance Type: Medium to large instances (e.g., AWS m5.large or m5.xlarge) with at least 2 CPUs and 8 GB of RAM.
  * Roles: Control plane components such as the API server, etcd, controller manager, and scheduler.

* Worker Nodes:

  * Number of Workers: Start with 3-5 worker nodes and scale based on load and resource utilization.
  * Instance Type: Medium instances (e.g., AWS m5.large) with at least 2 CPUs and 8 GB of RAM. You might need larger instances depending on the application's resource requirements.
  * Auto-scaling: Enable cluster auto-scaling to dynamically adjust the number of worker nodes based on the current load.

2. Networking:

* CNI Plugin: Use a robust CNI plugin like Calico, Weave, or Flannel.
* Load Balancer: Use a cloud provider’s load balancer to distribute traffic to your services (e.g., AWS ELB, Azure Load Balancer).
* Ingress Controller: Deploy an Ingress controller (e.g., NGINX Ingress Controller) to manage external access to the services.

3. Storage:
* Persistent Storage: Use a cloud provider’s managed storage solution for persistent volumes (e.g., AWS EBS, Azure Disk).
* Storage Classes: Define storage classes to manage different types of storage needs (e.g., fast SSD for high I/O applications, standard HDD for less critical data).

4. Monitoring and Logging:
* Monitoring: Implement a monitoring solution like Prometheus with Grafana for metrics and alerting.
* Logging: Use a centralized logging solution like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) for log aggregation and analysis.

5. Security:
* RBAC: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to control access to cluster resources.
* Network Policies: Use network policies to control traffic between pods.
* Secrets Management: Store sensitive information using Kubernetes Secrets and integrate with a secrets management solution like HashiCorp Vault if needed.

6. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
* CI/CD Tools: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or CircleCI.
* Container Registry: Use a secure container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR) to store and manage your Docker images.

7. Backup and Disaster Recovery:
* Backup Strategy: Implement a regular backup strategy for your application data and cluster state.
* Disaster Recovery: Plan and test disaster recovery procedures to ensure quick recovery from failures.

Example Cluster Configuration on AWS:

Master Nodes:
* Instance Type: 3 x m5.large (2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM)

Worker Nodes:
* Instance Type: 5 x m5.large (2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM)
* Auto-scaling: Enabled

Networking:
* CNI Plugin: Calico (Calico is a robust and efficient solution for managing container network connectivity and security, making it a popular choice for Kubernetes and other container orchestration platforms)
* Load Balancer: AWS ELB
* Ingress Controller: NGINX

Storage:
* Persistent Storage: AWS EBS
* Storage Class: gp2 for general-purpose SSD

Monitoring and Logging:
* Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
* Logging: ELK stack

Security:
* RBAC: Enabled
* Network Policies: Configured
* Secrets Management: Kubernetes Secrets

CI/CD:
* CI/CD Tool: Jenkins
* Container Registry: AWS ECR

Backup and Disaster Recovery:
* Backup: Regular EBS snapshots
* Disaster Recovery: Documented and tested procedures

This set-up should provide a robust starting point for serving around 3,000 users. You will need to monitor the cluster's performance continuously and make adjustments based on actual usage and requirements.

Additional Considerations:
* Horizontal Pod Autoscaling: Enable horizontal pod auto-scaling to automatically adjust the number of pods in a deployment based on CPU/memory usage.
* Vertical Pod Autoscaling: Consider vertical pod auto-scaling to adjust the resource requests and limits of pods automatically.
* Service Mesh: Implement a service mesh like Istio or Linkerd for advanced traffic management, security, and observability.
* Application Performance Monitoring (APM): Integrate an APM tool (e.g., New Relic, Datadog) for deeper insights into application performance.
* Cost Management: Use cost management tools and practices to keep track of expenses and optimize resource usage.

By following these guidelines and continuously monitoring and optimizing your cluster, you can ensure a reliable, scalable, and efficient Kubernetes environment capable of serving your application's user base 

Kubeadm port requirements: Please refer to the following image and make sure all the ports are allowed for the control plane (master) and the worker nodes. If you are setting up the kubeadm cluster cloud servers, ensure you allow the ports in the firewall configuration.
