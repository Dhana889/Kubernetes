1. Recently created Pod status is showing Pening, how to resolve it?

Answer: Run the Kubectl describe pod pod_name command. Describe command provides detailed information about the pod, such as its current state, labels, conditions and related events
Somme common reasons for Pod status showing as Pending:-
Insufficient resources: If the cluster doesn’t have enough resources (CPU, memory, etc.) to meet the pod’s requirements, the pod will remain in a pending state until the conditions are met.
Node readiness: If any nodes are not in a Ready state, pods cannot be scheduled on those nodes, causing them to remain in a pending state.
Incorrect resource requests: If the requested resources are too high, Kubernetes might not be able to find a suitable node to schedule the pod.
To troubleshoot pending pods, it’s essential to:

Check the pod’s status and events using kubectl describe pod.
Verify node readiness and resource availability using kubectl get nodes and kubectl top.
Review pod specifications, including resource requests and limits.
Adjust resource requests and limits as needed.
